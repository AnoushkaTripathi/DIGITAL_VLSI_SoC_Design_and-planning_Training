# Digital VLSI SoC Design and planning Training

Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we will delve into the process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file using the OpenLane ASIC flow. The flow is composed of several key steps, starting with an RTL file and culminating in a GDS file.

## Lessons Learned

Understanding the RTL to GDS Flow:

1. Grasped the end-to-end process of converting a high-level hardware description to a physical ASIC layout.
Recognized the importance of each step in the flow, from synthesis to sign-off.

2. Synthesis:

Learned how RTL is converted to a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries.
Identified the different views of cells (Liberty, HDL, SPICE, Layout).

3. Floor and Power Planning:
Understood the significance of floor planning in chip partitioning and I/O pad placement.



## DAY 1

The RTL to GDSII flow is a process in VLSI design that converts an RTL
description of a digital circuit into a physical layout ready for fabrication. It
involves stages like RTL synthesis, floor planning, placement, routing, and
ultimately generating the GDSII file format, which contains the layout data.
This meticulous process ensures the final IC layout accurately reflects the
desired functionality and meets fabrication requirements
